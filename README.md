🌦 Indian Weather App - Brief Overview

This *Indian Weather App* is a simple and intuitive Python application designed to fetch and display real-time weather information for various states in India. It leverages a clean graphical user interface (GUI) and integrates with a weather API to deliver up-to-date weather data.


📚 Libraries Used

1. Tkinter (tkinter) 🖥
   - Description: Tkinter is Python's standard GUI toolkit. It is used to create desktop applications with graphical elements like buttons, labels, and menus.
   - Application: In this app, Tkinter is used to build the user interface, including the main window, dropdown menu for state selection, and labels that display weather data.
   - Use Cases: Commonly used in small to medium-sized desktop applications where a quick and simple interface is needed.

2. Requests (requests) 🌐
   - Description: Requests is a powerful and user-friendly HTTP library in Python. It simplifies making HTTP requests, such as GET and POST, to interact with web services.
   - Application: The app uses the requests library to make API calls to the OpenWeatherMap service, fetching the latest weather data based on the selected state.
   - Use Cases: Widely used in applications that require interaction with web APIs, downloading content from the web, or handling RESTful services.
